"sqr","The square of the given integer."
"log2","The floor of the binary logarithm of the given integer. Triggers assertion failure on non-positive arguments."
"div_signed","Integral division, interpreting both given numbers as signed."
"sqrt","The floor of the square root of the given integer. Fails if the argument is negative. Computation is based on Newton's method."
"gcd","The greatest common divisor of the given two arguments which are interpreted as unsigned integers. Computing is based on Euclid's algorithm."
"pow_pre","Raising a field element given as the first argument to the power of the second argument. The second argument is an integer in `$pre`. Computing uses the fast exponentiation algorithm."
"pow_pre_inf","Raising an unbounded integer given as the first argument to the power of the second argument. Both arguments are in `$pre`. Computing uses the fast exponentiation algorithm."
"is_zero","True iff the given field element equals zero."
"eq","True iff the given two field elements are equal."
"neq","True iff the given two field elements are distinct."
"max_pre","The larger of the given two integers in `$pre`."
"min_pre","The smaller of the given two integers in `$pre`."
"uint_to_bool","Converting the given integer to boolean. Assumes that the argument is either 0 or 1."
"divide_modulo","Dividing the first given field element by the second one in the field."
"invert_modulo","The reciprocal of the given field element."
