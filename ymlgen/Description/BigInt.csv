"BigInt_modconst","The remainder of the value of the given BigInt object upon division by the given integer. The result is a normalized BigInt object. Fails if the given list does not contain a SizeAsserter object for the number of bits per block."
"BigInt_mod_div","Division of the first given BigInt object by the second given BigInt object in the residue class ring modulo the integer given as the third argument. The result is normalized but the integrity of normalization is not checked. Fails if the numbers of bits per block differ in the given BigInt objects."
